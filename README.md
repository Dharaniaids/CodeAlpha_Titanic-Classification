Titanic Classification: Predicting Survivors
Project Overview
This project focuses on building a predictive model to determine which passengers survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, ticket class, and more. The dataset used for this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which has been widely used in the data science community for machine learning classification tasks.

Project Objective
The goal of this project is to create a classification model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not, using various passenger attributes.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from the Titanic dataset, which contains the following attributes:

PassengerId: Unique ID for each passenger
Survived: Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)
Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name: Passenger name
Sex: Gender of the passenger
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Tools and Libraries
The following tools and libraries were used in the project:

Python 3.x
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
NumPy: For numerical computations
Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization
Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the classification model
Steps Involved
Data Exploration: Understanding the dataset and handling missing values.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features and preparing the data for modeling.
Data Visualization: Visualizing relationships between features and survival.
Model Building: Applying machine learning algorithms to build a classification model.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Machine Learning Models Used
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest Classifier
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Results
The model with the highest accuracy was Random Forest Classifier, achieving an accuracy of X% on the test set.
